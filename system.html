				<h2 class="editable">Your payload</h2>
				<p class="editable">The payload is the part of the satellite that fullfills its purpose. The carrier satellite supports the payload with electricity, communication and processing capabilitie. We provide you with different sensing payloads to fly or test. We strongly advise you to be creative and design your own payload and provide you a hardware development kit (HDK). An requirement for this is that the payload has the same or a smaller outline than the carrier satellite to be compatible. The HDK includes the header locations and design limitations. </p>
