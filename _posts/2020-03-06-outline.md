Today, we are unclassifying the mechanical design outline of our next generation. 
![Outline](/images/outline.png)

This design features small size, symmetry and solar power from all 6 sides. 
The red line is the outline which is milled and cut. The grey areas are the vertical solar cells, which are soldered to the main PCB.
On the top side of this design, a massive solar cell provides sufficient power which is stored in the supercapacitor (round outline in the middle) 
The golden pins are the headers and connectors, which connect solar cells and the payload pin. The lower 10 1.27mm header are compliant with Cortex-M Debug Connectors.
