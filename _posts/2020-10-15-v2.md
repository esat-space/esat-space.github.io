In this prototype, four of the six solar cells are already mounted. On the top sides and side slots, small solar cells are intalled to assure current in every attitude and allow sun tracking. On the bottom we use a big 6-series triple-junction solar cell. The visible main PCB features the payload and debugging connector, solar charging with MPPT and efficient boost-buck voltage control. It also contains the 9-axis Inertial Measuement Unit (IMU) and a spectrometer.
