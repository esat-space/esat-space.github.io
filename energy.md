				<p class="editable">6 Individual solar cells provide power to the system at all times when in sunlight. One of the solar cells is bigger than the others and is used as the main power source.</p>		
				<p class="editable">Energy is stored in the supercapacitor to allow sensing in the earth shadow and RF signal bursts. The energy conversion on board is mostly done by energy efficient buck-boost converters. </p>			
				<p class="editable">The performance of the solar cells is sampled with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and also by the main processor to sense the sun's direction.</p>
