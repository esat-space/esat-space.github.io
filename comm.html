				<h2 class="editable">Fight-Proven Coding <br/> since 1977</h2>
				
				<p class="editable">To allow an error free communication channel between the satellite and ground station, we use the concatenated code (7,1/2). This coding scheme is still used in NASAs Deep Space Network to communicate with Voyager 1, which is 149 AU (Earth-Sun distance) away from Earth. (2020)</p>

				<p class="editable">Because eSat will be deployed in LEO (Low earth orbit), we do not need the big 30m radio antennas like used in the Deep Space Network. For communicating with eSat, a handheld 13dBi yagi antenna, which is included in our kit, is sufficient.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Onboard antenna: "Smart Metal"</h2>
				<p class="editable">Because eSatv2 does not have pointing capabilities, we have to use a simple antenna dipole, to be able to communicate with the satellite from all directions. To store and deploy the antenna safely in space, we use a custom formed antenna made out of a shape-memory alloy. This special metal will be freely deformable when cold to store, but will change to its desired shape when heated by the sun in space.</p>
				<p class="editable">We tested the hysteresis memory effect with a heart-shaped wire, as visible in the picture.</p>
